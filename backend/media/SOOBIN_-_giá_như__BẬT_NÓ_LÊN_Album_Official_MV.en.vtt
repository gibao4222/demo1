00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:44.162
As the morning sun glows, that’s when we’d part

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:52.202
You said “let's end this here”, although I’ve tried my best

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:58.118
It’s been forever since we’ve talked all night

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:01.451
It’s been forever since we've made a toast and drank the night away 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.534
Just like that - we grew more quiet, our love faded

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:08.992
That’s love - it ain’t easy to say 

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:14.949
If only you wanted me - to be the one taking away your worries 

00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:19.324
To run away together like there’s no tomorrow 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.490
Are you really this heartless? Do you not care at all?

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:30.614
If only you wanted me - to be next to you and resolving all our problems 

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:34.738
So that we never have to know what loneliness tastes like

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:39.738
If only you wanted it that way

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:43.237
After all the fighting ( Can’t be better )

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:45.362
In the end - we ( Can’t be closer )

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:47.153
The night takes over

00:01:47.153 --> 00:01:49.153
Leaving me behind in bewilderness

00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:52.444
You won’t check my message, forgetting all the special days 

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:55.944
Forgetting all we’ve done together… cuz…

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:59.527
It’s been forever since we’ve talked all night

00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:02.985
It’s been forever since we've made a toast and drank the night away 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.026
Just like that - we grew more quiet, our love faded

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:10.442
Nothing else

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:15.941
If only you wanted me - to be the one taking away your worries

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:20.399
To run away together like there’s no tomorrow 

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:25.774
Are you really this heartless? Do you not care at all? 

00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:31.689
If only you wanted me - to be next to you and resolving all our problems 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.022
So that we never have to know what loneliness tastes like 

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:40.688
If only you wanted it that way

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.187
I’m still here, but I’m unable to hold on to us

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:51.187
We’re split two ways so the agony would vanish like clouds

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:52.978
Since when did it rain?

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:57.603
Washing away all the footprints on our journey 

00:02:57.603 --> 00:03:04.352
I’ve been wanting to throw it all away but instead I’m drowning in thoughts

00:03:04.352 --> 00:03:08.268
If only we never met, things would have been different

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:15.642
There would have been no today and none of this pain 

00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:28.557
If only you wanted me - to be the one taking away your worries 

00:03:28.557 --> 00:03:32.390
To run away together like there’s no tomorrow 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.723
Are you really this heartless? Do you not care at all? 

00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:43.805
If only you wanted me - to be next to you and resolving all our problems 

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:47.596
So that we never have to know what loneliness tastes like 

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:52.846
If only you wanted it that way

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:10.427
If only
