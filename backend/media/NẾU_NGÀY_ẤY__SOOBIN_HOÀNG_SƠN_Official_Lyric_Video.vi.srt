00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,240
Just few years ago,

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,500
when i started to grow up

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,600
Met you in that afternoon, feeling amazed then turned speechless

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,520
You were pure and innocent, those sparkle eyes looks like never fall in love

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,820
Cause hesitate to speak out

6
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,000
so this love still lonely

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,600
You never know,

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm always here

9
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,820
Seeing you far away

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,280
Times passing by

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,180
If that day i confessed my love to you

12
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,220
Would you trust me and take my hand

13
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,380
Together, we can go through all hard winter

14
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,020
If that day i were the one that you want

15
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,160
Whether it sunshine or raining

16
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,620
Now i had a beautiful story

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:06,240
Just few years ago, when i was growing

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,580
Met you in that afternoon, i went speechless

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,820
You were pure and innocent, those sparkle eyes looked like never fall in love

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,900
Cause scared to speak out, our love became lonely

21
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,260
You never know

22
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm always here

23
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,700
Looking at your shadow are being faded

24
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,720
Time passing by...oh uh wahhh

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,220
If that day i confessed my love to you

26
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,120
Would you trust me and take my hand

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
We can go through all the pain

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,740
If that day i were the one that you want

29
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:20,760
Whether it's raining or sunshine

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Now I had a beautiful story

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,220
Behind the smile for you, i walk away

32
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Behind my laughing eyes, there's nothing but regret

33
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:45,360
Wind are blowing leaves this afternoon
Our love story put back in my dream

34
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:53,420
The sweet dream i gave you

35
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,180
If that day i confessed my love to you

36
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:11,420
Would you trust me and take my hand
Together go throught the winter

37
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:18,380
If that day i were the one that you always dreaming

38
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,360
Whether raining or sunshine

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,680
Now I had a beautiful story

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,560
Whether raining or sunshine

41
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,880
Now i had...

42
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,960
Beautiful Story.
