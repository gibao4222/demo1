1
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:44,162
As the morning sun glows, that’s when we’d part

2
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,202
You said “let's end this here”, although I’ve tried my best

3
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:58,118
It’s been forever since we’ve talked all night

4
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:01,451
It’s been forever since we've made a toast and drank the night away 

5
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:05,534
Just like that - we grew more quiet, our love faded

6
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:08,992
That’s love - it ain’t easy to say 

7
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:14,949
If only you wanted me - to be the one taking away your worries 

8
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:19,324
To run away together like there’s no tomorrow 

9
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,490
Are you really this heartless? Do you not care at all?

10
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:30,614
If only you wanted me - to be next to you and resolving all our problems 

11
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:34,738
So that we never have to know what loneliness tastes like

12
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:39,738
If only you wanted it that way

13
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:43,237
After all the fighting ( Can’t be better )

14
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,362
In the end - we ( Can’t be closer )

15
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:47,153
The night takes over

16
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:49,153
Leaving me behind in bewilderness

17
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:52,444
You won’t check my message, forgetting all the special days 

18
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:55,944
Forgetting all we’ve done together… cuz…

19
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:59,527
It’s been forever since we’ve talked all night

20
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:02,985
It’s been forever since we've made a toast and drank the night away 

21
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,026
Just like that - we grew more quiet, our love faded

22
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,442
Nothing else

23
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:15,941
If only you wanted me - to be the one taking away your worries

24
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:20,399
To run away together like there’s no tomorrow 

25
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:25,774
Are you really this heartless? Do you not care at all? 

26
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:31,689
If only you wanted me - to be next to you and resolving all our problems 

27
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:36,022
So that we never have to know what loneliness tastes like 

28
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,688
If only you wanted it that way

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,187
I’m still here, but I’m unable to hold on to us

30
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:51,187
We’re split two ways so the agony would vanish like clouds

31
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,978
Since when did it rain?

32
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:57,603
Washing away all the footprints on our journey 

33
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:04,352
I’ve been wanting to throw it all away but instead I’m drowning in thoughts

34
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:08,268
If only we never met, things would have been different

35
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:15,642
There would have been no today and none of this pain 

36
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:28,557
If only you wanted me - to be the one taking away your worries 

37
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:32,390
To run away together like there’s no tomorrow 

38
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,723
Are you really this heartless? Do you not care at all? 

39
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:43,805
If only you wanted me - to be next to you and resolving all our problems 

40
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:47,596
So that we never have to know what loneliness tastes like 

41
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,846
If only you wanted it that way

42
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:10,427
If only
